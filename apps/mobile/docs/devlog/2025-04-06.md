## Notes

### Podcast Playback Bugs

Currently, the app is not playing the podcast,
and also not showing the media player.

On top of that, because the logs are not showing up,
I can't really tell what's going wrong with the app.

Can consider rolling back to the previous commit
and see if that resolves the issue

- [x] Fix logging

Adding `--device` to the `pnpm expo run:android` makes it work without tunnel,
and the logs are showing up again.

- [x] Get fast refresh working again
- [x] Fix issues with media player

### Media Player Design

- [x] Test if we can have multiple different tracks playing.
- [x] Update the basic design of the player

I don't really like the design at the moment,
I think it should be more playful but should prioritise
functionality for now.

- [x]  add sheet for podcasts

### Theming

[Tamagui Docs on Theming](https://tamagui.dev/docs/intro/themes)

The main idea is that we can theme with standard keys.
After that, we pass it to our tamagui config and specify the
theme with the theme provider.

The docs recommends defining the themes in a separate `theme.ts` file.

### "problem loading the project" error again

Same issue again even when runnning `pnpm expo run:android --device`.
Might be a fluke that it worked in the WiFi outside.

Tunnel works, but no fast refresh and no logs.
Others have been complaining about the [same issue](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/26254).

A bit of a pain as we have to restart the app every time we want to run it.
And no logs means that it's hard to debug things.

Best solution is probably just to use hotspot?
Using a hotspot works, just might have to worry about data costs.

### Transcription

Next priority task is to get the transcriptions working.

Everything else apart from that is quite secondary.

- [x] Test out cloudflare whisper API locally

Cloudflare API issues - they don't list the limits for the audio file size / length
anywhere in the docs.
The last update on the [forum post](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/workers-ai-speech-recognition-request-limits/662925/9) was from June 2024.

We might just have to eat the cost and use Groq,
but we also have to chunk the audio based on the [tutorial](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook/blob/main/tutorials/audio-chunking/audio_chunking_tutorial.ipynb).

I considered compressing to m4a or something else that requires less space.
But `ffmpeg-kit` has been retired, so it seems non-trivial to get ffmpeg running.

We still have to chunk the audio for the mp3 and to do so without using ffmpeg.
The groq tutorial on combining overlapping chunks is interesting, but also unnecessary
with Gemini Flash.
Instead of using an algorithmic way of finding matches, we can just ask Gemini to fix any inconsistencies
or overlaps in the transcription later on
(probably in something like SRT format that we can reparse and doesn't cost too many tokens).

It seems like we will have to touch native code either way
since chunking based on frame headers will still require native code to avoid blocking the
main UI thread.

I guess the trick now is to have a server that handles all of these calls like transcription.

### Transcription Workarounds

Workarounds are possible - we just need to set up the sync for transcripts and the other stuff
then we can create the desktop version of the app to handle the chunking and transcription (perhaps even on device)

In general, we should avoid native code for now (it's too slow to launch).
We can investigate how other people do their chunking for longer transcriptions.

we need to sync strategically - fetching the whole RSS feed again is pointless
perhaps downloaded episode should live in a separate realm from everything else

- [ ] Conceptualise data schema
- [ ] Check if there is a transcription field in the podcasts downloaded
- [ ] How to persist partial transcriptions? (require downloads)
- [ ] Set up Workers AI API for Cloudflare to query

I think the entire transcription can be stored as append only txt
file for now (just assume that we don't need to search, or any search can be done in memory).

- [ ] Research how to store secure variables / ENV in Expo app

- [ ] Handling different file formats?

UPDATE: put transcriptions and note-taking on hold first while fixing the major bugs

### Note-taking

Add keyboard, ability to quote (I think similar to .srt formatting will be good) and then type out some notes.

Ability to view all the notes for an episode.
We can start off with something simple like a messaging kind of UI
and then iterate from there.

Look at Mobbin for some note-taking inspiration.

Also need a library to handle text area and potentially text formatting.
