## Notes

Main task: getting refresh to work properly

See the discussion in [2025-04-10](2025-04-10.md#refresh) for how to handle the various issues with RSS feed.

### Refresh Version 1

Refetch all the RSS feeds upon refresh of podcast /
RSS feed in parallel.

Handle deconflicting episodes.

- [x] Naive update of podcast feed

## Bugs

- [x] Flicker in the image when refetching - unnecessary re-renders?
- [x] Fix order of podcasts for podcast page
- [ ] Fix crashing when playing podcast

## UI Fixes

- [x] Optimistic UI update to pending for downloads
- [x] Reduce "inbox" padding

## Preview build

Had to update the `eas.json` file to have the preview profile.

I should have just created the configuration directly as specified
on [this page](https://docs.expo.dev/build/eas-json/).

In addition, I installed Expo Orbit to more easily install the
application on my android phone rather than sharing the `.apk` file using
something like Google Drive.

The preview really is much faster than the development build.
At least we can not worry as much about smoothness of the final application.
