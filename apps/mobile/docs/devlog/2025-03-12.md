## Research

### Understand React Native Track Player

### Handling assets and saving files to the device with expo

[Expo file system](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem/)

- Expo supports resumable downloads
- We can connect each file with a unique identifier that we store in the database
- Filesystem.documentDirectory is the path, file will stay there unless explicitly deleted

### Using SQLite with Expo

[Expo SQLite](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite/)

`FileSystem.documentDirectory`

- We can browse the database with the the drizzle-studio-expo dev tools plugin.
- We can also easily use a KV store with `expo-sqlite/kv-store`

Store sample assets in the `/assets` directory.
Using this, render the basic podcast player UI.

Example rendering of an image (using the `require` syntax):

```tsx
<Image source={require('./assets/images/example.png')} />
```

There are other ways for loading assets.
