## Notes

### Refactor Data Fetching

We don't really need live queries, we can always refetch the data
again if needed (whenever we open the tab).

Instead, we can just wrap our data in a basic `useSQLiteQuery` hook
which allows us to get loading and error states.

I think this will make the loading of the podcast page a bit
more snappy.
We do need to implement pull to refresh though.

- [x] refactor to use sqlite query hook to avoid lag on first render

- [x] Delete podcast

Create a podcast actions sheet - for now there is only
the option to delete, with an alert dialog
warning you that you're about to delete the podcast.

The delete behaviour would be to remove the podcast,
episode, downloads and any of the downloaded
files from the database.

This clean up might take a while to do, so there should
be some kind of loading UI that indicates this.

Unfortunately I don't think we can handle rollback
operations for this, but we can try grouping all of the operations into a single drizzle transaction.
But first the files and the resumable download handldes need to be deleted first.

- [x] Fix re-renders on the podcast actions sheet

Bug fixes - updating the styling of the download card,
fixing the download update issue (forgot to `await` the `updateDownloadState` call)

### Audio Playback

Get audio playback working for the downloaded episodes.

### Development Builds

Reading about [Expo development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
which seems quite relevant for using `react-media-track-player` which has native code.

Details on [creating a build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/).

First build took about 5 mins.

After that I could run using `pnpm expo start --tunnel`.

### React Native Track Player Bug

There was a crash, but it was fixed by running `npx expo install react-native-svg`.

Getting some strange errors now after installing `react-native-track-player`.
Going to clean and rebuild the android project.

```bash
z android
./gradlew clean
z ..
npx expo run:android
```

Doesn't solve the issue, seems like this has been an open issue with React Native's new architecture
for the [last year](https://github.com/doublesymmetry/react-native-track-player/issues/2293).

The suggested solution was to disable the new architectur
which can be done in `app.json` by setting `newArchEnabled` to `false` for Expo
and in the `android/gradle.properties` file by setting `newArchEnabled=false`.

Doing both fixed the issue.

### Podcast Playback

Added podcast playback.

I think I should refactor the episode download card for completed and not completed cards.
