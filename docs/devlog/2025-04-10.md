BACKLOG: Transcription (see [2025-04-06](2025-04-06.md#transcription))

Write up on safe area view
Get audio playback working

### Nice-to-haves

- [ ] The podcast sheet should fetch a subset of the show's information (we shouldn't fetch the whole XML - some podcasts like the Economist have like 50 MB RSS feed from 2015 and don't support Last-Modified headers)

I think the main idea is to add the podcast first, then populate the episodes in the background - perhaps a toast that drops down telling the user the episodes are being loaded.

Then the SQLite table should have a state variable for whether the episodes have been loaded or not.

- [ ] add error state for new podcast sheet

- [ ] Add episodes in batches

Or else we risk too many SQL variables error.
We can just test with a podcast with many episodes like Joe Rogan or Economist.

- [ ] special scroll bar similar to google photos for quickly jumping to different dates
_ [ ] research about safe area view and how to remove the notch section at the top.
- [ ] research into download types
- [ ] explore logging mechanism in expo
- [ ] Add vibrations (e.g. when scrubbing through the audio)
- [ ] how mp3s and audio files work
- [ ] Fix animations - create button variant for bouncy animations

Downloads / Inbox

- [ ] Format the download text in a better way (not COMPLETED).
- [ ] Add live updates of the data when downloading - consume the in-memory data for downloads? or reload in some way
- [ ] Tap to download in the inbox (currently onEpisodePress is empty)

### Deleting podcasts

- [ ] Be able to quit the app / pause and resume the download later
- [ ] Be able to cancel the download
- [ ] Be able to delete downloaded items

### Bugs

No infinite scroll for the past podcast episodes.
Search for podcast episodes.

crash when too many episodes
podcasts should be shown in reverse order so the newest one is animated in

- [ ] fix deprecation warning
- [ ] fix wrong order for new podcasts again

## Notes

### Bug Fix: Blocking UI

When downloading a podcast, the UI is blocked (cannot navigate tabs) when
the download is in progress.

To debug, I commented out the progress update code - and the UI is no longer blocked.
Possible solution - throttle the download updates.

Throttle has to be specific - we cannot throttle the completion
update.

DONE

### Inbox View

Refactor podcast episode view into component and podcast.
Separate into container and view components.

The header should be passed down to the generic episode
list.

Reverse chronological order of all saved podcasts.

Needed to update the schema because `pubDate` is just a string.
We needed a separate column to store the unix timestamp
for sorting the episodes.

- [x] DONE
- [x] pull to refresh
- [x] include download status

### Improve Download UI

Show which episodes have already been downloaded (join).

### Refresh

There are multiple ways of handling the partial feed.

We can use the `requestSize` option for `podcast-xml-parser`.
But we can also use the `Last-Modified` header for those RSS feeds that support it.

Things to test: time for fetching long feed (e.g. The Daily).

- Limiting by episodes
- Limiting to 0 episodes
- Limiting by request size
- Using Last-Modified header

How to treat overlaps?
We can use the guid to detect.

Use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to handle the duplicates.

Optimization: save on the bandwidth

1. Use HEAD: might not be supported by RSS feeds
2. AbortController: might be useful

The issue is sending the conditional GET request â€“ if the RSS feed doesn't support it,
we might start downloading the whole feed a second time, wasting bandwidth.

Handle refresh logic of RSS feed (and deconflicting episodes).

TODO: add new index for podcastId, timestamp.

### Inbox improvements

Show the podcast name for each episode.

### Building

How big are the applications supposed to be.
