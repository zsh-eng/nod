BACKLOG: Transcription (see [2025-04-06](2025-04-06.md#transcription))

Write up on safe area view
Get audio playback working

### Nice-to-haves

- [ ] The podcast sheet should fetch a subset of the show's information (we shouldn't fetch the whole XML - some podcasts like the Economist have like 50 MB RSS feed from 2015 and don't support Last-Modified headers)

I think the main idea is to add the podcast first, then populate the episodes in the background - perhaps a toast that drops down telling the user the episodes are being loaded.

Then the SQLite table should have a state variable for whether the episodes have been loaded or not.

- [ ] add error state for new podcast sheet

- [ ] Add episodes in batches

Or else we risk too many SQL variables error.
We can just test with a podcast with many episodes like Joe Rogan or Economist.

- [ ] special scroll bar similar to google photos for quickly jumping to different dates
_ [ ] research about safe area view and how to remove the notch section at the top.
- [ ] research into download types
- [ ] explore logging mechanism in expo
- [ ] Add vibrations (e.g. when scrubbing through the audio)
- [ ] how mp3s and audio files work
- [ ] Fix animations - create button variant for bouncy animations

### Deleting podcasts

- [ ] Be able to quit the app / pause and resume the download later
- [ ] Be able to cancel the download
- [ ] Be able to delete downloaded items

### Bugs

crash when too many episodes
cannot delete the entered URL
never clear state when sheet is dismissed
podcasts should be shown in reverse order so the newest one is animated in

- [ ] Currently, downloading a podcast blocks the UI's main thread.

A LOT of laggy parts of the app and polish still needed.

## Notes

### Bug Fix: Blocking UI

When downloading a podcast, the UI is blocked (cannot navigate tabs) when
the download is in progress.

To debug, I commented out the progress update code - and the UI is no longer blocked.
Possible solution - throttle the download updates.

Throttle has to be specific - we cannot throttle the completion
update.

### Inbox View

Reverse chronological order of all saved podcasts

### Refresh

Handle refresh logic of RSS feed (and deconflicting episodes).

### Building

How big are the applications supposed to be.
