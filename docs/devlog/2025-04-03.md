## Notes

Trying to get the app running on the Android emulator.

Running with `--tunnel` flag, to see if it helps since I'm connected to the
public WiFi.

Fixes the issue, got the hello world Expo app running on the Android emulator.

Reset the project using `pnpm run reset-project`.

### Node fs issues

`podcast-partytime` requires access to `fs` module (apparently because it can handle file URI as well).

Investigating now whether to build a simplified RSS feed parser
(though doing this we'll have to give up certain things like handling seasons).

I'm ok with the tradeoff since the podcasts that I follow don't have season anyway.

### `podcast-xml-parser` library

Found [this library](https://github.com/krestaino/podcast-xml-parser) that
has pretty clear code and is MIT Licensed.

I don't think it's worth the time diving into the podcast namespace, so this library is a good fit, at least for now.

### Setting up SQLite

Using drizzle with Expo for type safety.

Currently trying to set up the initial tables for the app.

Followed Drizzle's guide on getting started with [Expo](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started/expo-new).

I do not understand why their "Expo SQLite" page doesn't mention this guide at all.
In general, it worked and I was able to get the database running.

Essentially what happened is:

1. Add your drizzle config and set the metro + babel config
2. Generate the migrations for the project
3. Apply the migrations at the top level of the app
