## Notes

Trying to get the app running on the Android emulator.

Running with `--tunnel` flag, to see if it helps since I'm connected to the
public WiFi.

Fixes the issue, got the hello world Expo app running on the Android emulator.

Reset the project using `pnpm run reset-project`.

### Node fs issues

`podcast-partytime` requires access to `fs` module (apparently because it can handle file URI as well).

Investigating now whether to build a simplified RSS feed parser
(though doing this we'll have to give up certain things like handling seasons).

I'm ok with the tradeoff since the podcasts that I follow don't have season anyway.

### `podcast-xml-parser` library

Found [this library](https://github.com/krestaino/podcast-xml-parser) that
has pretty clear code and is MIT Licensed.

I don't think it's worth the time diving into the podcast namespace, so this library is a good fit, at least for now.

### Setting up SQLite

Using drizzle with Expo for type safety.

Currently trying to set up the initial tables for the app.

Followed Drizzle's guide on getting started with [Expo](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started/expo-new).

I do not understand why their "Expo SQLite" page doesn't mention this guide at all.
In general, it worked and I was able to get the database running.

Essentially what happened is:

1. Add your drizzle config and set the metro + babel config
2. Generate the migrations for the project
3. Apply the migrations at the top level of the app

### UI Components

It's worth conceptualising different UI ideas in the future, but I think I'll just make use of a popular UI component library for now to appease my eyes while developing.

Seems like tamagui is pretty good for react native.

Interestingly, the sheet component requires you to set the background
colour of the overlap to transparent or a shadow, or it defaults to white.
That seems like pretty bad default behaviour.

### Add Podcast Sheet

I had an idea of having an "add podcast" sheet that would allow
you to paste a podcast URL and then add it to the list.

I tried making the input autofocus, but if the sheet animates
in as the same time as the keyboard, the positioning is wonky.

### Navigation

Research into how Expo handles navigation and different pages.
Is it file-based like most frameworks?
