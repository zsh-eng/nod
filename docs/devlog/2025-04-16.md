## Notes

Main task: getting refresh to work properly

See the discussion in [2025-04-10](2025-04-10.md#refresh) for how to handle the various issues with RSS feed.

### Refresh Version 1

Refetch all the RSS feeds upon refresh of podcast / 
RSS feed in parallel.

Handle deconflicting episodes.

- [x] Naive update of podcast feed

## Bugs

- [x] Flicker in the image when refetching - unnecessary re-renders?

## UI Fixes

- [x] Optimistic UI update to pending for downloads
