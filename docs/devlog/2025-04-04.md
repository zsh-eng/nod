## TODO

Podcast page

- [ ] tap to start playing the episode

Media player

- [ ] Mini media player at the bottom
- [ ] Just play/pause

Additional Tasks

- [ ] The podcast sheet should fetch a subset of the show's information (we shouldn't fetch the whole XML - some podcasts like the Economist have like 50 MB RSS feed from 2015 and don't support Last-Modified headers)

I think the main idea is to add the podcast first, then populate the episodes in the background - perhaps a toast that drops down telling the user the episodes are being loaded.

Then the SQLite table should have a state variable for whether the episodes have been loaded or not.

- [ ] add error state for new podcast sheet

- [ ] Add episodes in batches

Or else we risk too many SQL variables error.
We can just test with a podcast with many episodes like Joe Rogan or Economist.

- [ ] special scroll bar similar to google photos for quickly jumping to different dates

research about safe area view and how to remove the notch section at the top.
research into download types
explore logging mechanism in expo

## Notes

### Handling downloads

Read about resumable downloads in [expo](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem/).

Download progress can be stored in a separate table - easy for
us to query which podcasts have been already downloaded.

We can store the state of the download.
Being inside the table implicitly means that it should be downloaded
and can be in progress, failed, etc.

we also want to store the download handle when it's in progress (continuously store it?)

Perhaps a download context provider to keep track of the download state
and issue stuff like toast notifications when the download is complete.

### Setting up download data structures

I kind of need to consider between having the `DownloadContextProvider` to be the global source of truth for the download state, or just having to manage active downloads.

I'm thinking just managing the active downloads is good enough, and we can render completed downloads separately.

Starting with the initial version, we're just going to maintain all of the downloads in-memory.

6.51pm taking a break now, currently working on integrating the expo resumable
downloads.

9.26pm  back.
Interestingly there is a background session type, might be worth exploring.

I'm capturing the "completed" state by expecting a final call to the callback function.
Here's the assumptions that I wrote down:

- Expo will always make a final call to the callback function when the progress completes.
- AND that it doesn't make another call after `pause` is called (this might trigger race condition
  of -> pause -> progress update)

I'm not sure if this is true, but we can test it out.

Required features

- [ ] Press "download" on a podcast --> transitions the state from not started to in progress (does nothing otherwise)
- [ ] Downloads / "Saved" tab - be able to see all the downloads and their statuses (bottom tab navgiation that's always available?)
    Should I separate the download tab and the saved tab? those are different ideas entirely - we can delete a download and still save the podcast.

- [ ] Be able to see the progress of the download
- [ ] Be able to quit the app / pause and resume the download later
- [ ] Be able to cancel the download
- [ ] Be able to delete downloaded items
