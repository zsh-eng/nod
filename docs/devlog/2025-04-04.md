## Notes

### Handling downloads

Read about resumable downloads in [expo](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem/).

Download progress can be stored in a separate table - easy for
us to query which podcasts have been already downloaded.

We can store the state of the download.
Being inside the table implicitly means that it should be downloaded
and can be in progress, failed, etc.

we also want to store the download handle when it's in progress (continuously store it?)

Perhaps a download context provider to keep track of the download state
and issue stuff like toast notifications when the download is complete.

### Setting up download data structures

I kind of need to consider between having the `DownloadContextProvider` to be the global source of truth for the download state, or just having to manage active downloads.

I'm thinking just managing the active downloads is good enough, and we can render completed downloads separately.

Starting with the initial version, we're just going to maintain all of the downloads in-memory.

6.51pm taking a break now, currently working on integrating the expo resumable
downloads.

9.26pm  back.
Interestingly there is a background session type, might be worth exploring.

I'm capturing the "completed" state by expecting a final call to the callback function.
Here's the assumptions that I wrote down:

- Expo will always make a final call to the callback function when the progress completes.
- AND that it doesn't make another call after `pause` is called (this might trigger race condition
  of -> pause -> progress update)

I'm not sure if this is true, but we can test it out.

Refactored to use tab routes.

The main podcast content is under "home" and has the same stack navigation
as before.
The downloads page is under a separate tab now.

For some reason we need to ensure that the document directory exists or the download
will fail silently.

Required features

- [x] Press "download" on a podcast --> transitions the state from not started to in progress (does nothing otherwise)

### Persistence of download states

Now it's time to hook up the download states to the database.

Essentially, what we need to do is to persist whenever there is
a state change for an episode.
We should also move to the new `AppEpisodeDownload` types that
will allow for the discriminating union.

- [x] Downloads / "Saved" tab - be able to see all the downloads and their statuses (bottom tab navgiation that's always available?)
    Should I separate the download tab and the saved tab? those are different ideas entirely - we can delete a download and still save the podcast.
- [x] Be able to see the progress of the download

### Animations

Tamagui docs could definitely be improved - they don't explain how to
set up the animation library properly, and I can't still figure out
how to update the animation for hot reloading properly.
