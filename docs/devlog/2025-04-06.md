## TODO

Write up on safe area view
Get audio playback working

Podcast page

- [ ] tap to start playing the episode

Media player

- [ ] Mini media player at the bottom
- [ ] Just play/pause

### Nice-to-haves

- [ ] The podcast sheet should fetch a subset of the show's information (we shouldn't fetch the whole XML - some podcasts like the Economist have like 50 MB RSS feed from 2015 and don't support Last-Modified headers)

I think the main idea is to add the podcast first, then populate the episodes in the background - perhaps a toast that drops down telling the user the episodes are being loaded.

Then the SQLite table should have a state variable for whether the episodes have been loaded or not.

- [ ] add error state for new podcast sheet

- [ ] Add episodes in batches

Or else we risk too many SQL variables error.
We can just test with a podcast with many episodes like Joe Rogan or Economist.

- [ ] special scroll bar similar to google photos for quickly jumping to different dates
_ [ ] research about safe area view and how to remove the notch section at the top.
- [ ] research into download types
- [ ] explore logging mechanism in expo
- [ ] Add vibrations (e.g. when scrubbing through the audio)
- [ ] how mp3s and audio files work

### Deleting podcasts

- [ ] Be able to quit the app / pause and resume the download later
- [ ] Be able to cancel the download
- [ ] Be able to delete downloaded items

### Bugs

Bugs to fix - very long load for large rss feed
crash when too many episodes
cannot delete the entered URL
never clear state when sheet is dismissed
podcasts should be shown in reverse order so the newest one is animated in

## Notes

### Podcast Playback Bugs

Currently, the app is not playing the podcast,
and also not showing the media player.

On top of that, because the logs are not showing up,
I can't really tell what's going wrong with the app.

Can consider rolling back to the previous commit
and se

- [x] Fix logging

Adding `--device` to the `pnpm expo run:android` makes it work without tunnel,
and the logs are showing up again.

- [ ] Get fast refresh working again
- [ ] Fix issues with media player
e if that resolves the issue
