# Nod

## Motivation

Fix many of the annoyances of listening to podcasts on Spotify.

1. Extremely laggy to load podcasts / episodes
2. Changing from Wi-Fi to mobile data always causes the podcast to disconnect and continue to randomly pause even after switching full to mobile data

Add useful features for my podcast note-taking experience.

1. SponsorBlock - skip sponsor segments
2. Transcript - view the transcript of the episode
3. Notes - quickly take notes / highlight segments of the transcript which are automatically associated with the episode

Features to replicate from Spotify Podcasts:

1. Have an "inbox" of new episodes
2. Download episodes to listen offline
3. Set speed for podcast playback

Nice-to-haves:

1. Stream episodes as they come in
2. Search for specific episodes
3. Search for new podcasts (Podcast Index API?)
4. Light / dark theme
5. Desktop app and sync

## Learning

Because every project should teach you something.

1. Creating an Expo project
2. Working with RSS Feeds and podcasts.
   Handling partial feeds and RSS feeds which do and don't support Last-Modified headers.
3. Working with Whisper + Gemini Flash for transcription and SponsorBlock.
4. Basic text editing on mobile.
5. Audio player on mobile.
